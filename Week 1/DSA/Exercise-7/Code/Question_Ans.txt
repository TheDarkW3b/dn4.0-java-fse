Q: What is the base case and recursive case here?

A:
Base cases:
P(0) = 1000
P(1) = 1500

Recursive case:
P(n) = P(n-1) + P(n-2)

Q: What's the difference between plain recursion and optimized?

A:
- Plain recursion recomputes values, slow for large n (O(2^n))
- Optimized memoization caches results (O(n)), much faster
